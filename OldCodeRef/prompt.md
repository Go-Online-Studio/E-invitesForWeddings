**Prompt for Antigravity AI**

Act as an expert frontend developer and GSAP animation specialist. Your task is to build a highly immersive, mobile-optimized, animated wedding invitation in a single-file HTML format. All CSS must be inline within `<style>` tags, all JavaScript must be inline within `<script>` tags, and you must not use any build tools or frameworks. Adapt all selectors, CSS variables (`:root`), and copy to the specific sections described below.

Build the application following this strict structural and visual breakdown:

**1. Technical Architecture & Setup**

* **Document Structure:** Use a main card container (`#app`) constrained to a mobile width (e.g., `--card-width: 480px`).


* **Landscape Warning:** Implement a `#landscape-warning` overlay that displays only on screens where `orientation: landscape` and `max-height: 500px`, hiding the main app.


* **Viewport Handling:** Ensure `viewport-fit=cover` is in the meta tag. The very first piece of JS executed must be `setActualVh()` to calculate exact window height.


* **Scroll Locking:** The `body` must have `overflow: hidden` on initial load. Only add the `unlocked` class to allow scrolling after the intro sequence completes.



**2. Visual Sections & Animations**

* **Hero / Section 1:**
* *Assets:* Use `BG_sec1.webp` (Cover). Place `BellDecorSec1.webp` (4 copies) at the top, animating like a pendulum using 3D rotation. Place `BottomDecorSec1.webp` at the bottom (100% width).
* *Subject:* Wrap `Elephant.webp` and `FlowerOverlaySec1.webp` in a compact container positioned over the bottom decor. Replicate this on both sides facing inward. Animate the elephant with a slow, cinematic jump every 4 seconds.


* **Mehndi Section:**
* *Assets:* `MehndiBg.webp` (Cover), `TopDecorMehndi.webp` at the top, `MehndiCouple.webp` at the bottom.
* *Animation:* Implement an HTML5 canvas layer for falling marigold petals.


* **Haldi Section:**
* *Assets:* `BG_Haldi.webp` (Cover), `FlowerDecorTopHaldi.webp` at top center. Place 4 copies of `FlowerDecorLatkanHaldi.webp` hanging from the top.
* *Animation:* Wave the hanging decor gently with a continuous "calm wind" staggered flow. Implement the falling canvas petals over `HaldiLady.webp` at the bottom.


* **Sangeet / Dance Section:**
* *Assets:* `BgSangeet.webp` (Cover), `River.webp` (Static foreground), `CoupleDance.webp` behind the river layer.
* *Animation:* Create a continuous, infinite marquee animation over the river using multiple copies of `Swan.webp` and `LotusFloting.webp` floating left to right at varying speeds.


* **AI-Designed Wedding Date Reveal:**
* Design a custom section centered around a couple and a "vow fire". Generate custom particle/canvas animations (e.g., rose petals) triggered on scroll.



**3. Interactive Elements & JavaScript Logic**

* **Video Intro Logic:** Build a full-screen video intro overlay (`#intro-layer`). It must require one tap to play and must not be pauseable. Scrolling remains locked until the video ends. Once the video finishes, fade out the overlay, add the `.unlocked` class to the body, and make the Music FAB and Scroll Down indicator visible.


* **Music FAB:** Position the floating action button dynamically using `bottom: max(72px, calc(env(safe-area-inset-bottom, 0px) + 38px))`. It must toggle the background audio and switch between SVG on/off icons.


* **Canvas Petal Animation:** Calculate canvas size using `window.visualViewport?.height`. Cap the petal count between 10 and 30 for performance. You must check for `(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` and disable the canvas loop if matched.


* **Scroll Reveal:** Implement an `IntersectionObserver` to fade and slide elements up on scroll. Stagger sibling elements using CSS transition delays (`.reveal:nth-child(n)`). Ensure `initScrollReveal()` is called *only after* the intro finishes and the body is unlocked.



**4. RSVP Form & WhatsApp Integration**

* **Validation:** The form must validate that the user's Full Name and Phone Number are entered before submission.


* **Message Formatting:** The generated WhatsApp message must be stylized for luxury. Use visual divider lines (`━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━`), decorative headers (`✨ *[Event Name] — RSVP* ✨`), and contextual emojis (`👤 *Guest:*`, `💌 *Response:*`).


* **Routing:** Detect mobile vs. desktop to route to `[https://api.whatsapp.com/send](https://api.whatsapp.com/send)` or `[https://web.whatsapp.com/send](https://web.whatsapp.com/send)` respectively.



**5. Strict Footer Implementation**
You must include the exact footer below to handle iOS home indicators and Android gesture navigation safely:

```html
<footer class="footer" style="padding: clamp(40px,6vh,80px) max(20px, env(safe-area-inset-right, 0px)) calc(clamp(40px,6vh,80px) + env(safe-area-inset-bottom, 0px)) max(20px, env(safe-area-inset-left, 0px)); text-align: center; border-top: 1px solid rgba(231,191,133,0.2);">
  <p style="font-family:var(--script); font-size:clamp(1.8rem,5vw,2.8rem); color:var(--primary);">Thank You</p>
  <p style="color:var(--text-muted); font-size:0.85rem; margin-top:8px; letter-spacing:0.05em;">With the blessings of our elders and the warmth of your presence</p>
  <p style="margin-top:24px; font-size:0.75rem; color:var(--text-muted);">
    Designed by <a href="https://invitebox.in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" style="color:var(--primary); text-decoration:none; font-weight:600;">Invite&nbsp;Box</a>
  </p>
</footer>

```

**BUILD CHECKLIST (Must Verify All Before Completion):**

* [ ] `viewport-fit=cover` included in meta tags.


* [ ] `setActualVh()` runs immediately as the first JS command.


* [ ] `history.scrollRestoration = 'manual'` and `scrollTo(0,0)` execute on load.


* [ ] `body` defaults to `overflow: hidden`; `.unlocked` is added only after intro.


* [ ] FAB and Scroll Indicator remain hidden until `reveal()` is called.


* [ ] WhatsApp message uses visual borders and bold/italic markdown.


* [ ] `initScrollReveal()` called after `.unlocked` is added.


* [ ] All icons are inline SVGs.
